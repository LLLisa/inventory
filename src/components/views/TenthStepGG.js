          Recovery in Narcotics Anonymous is about learning how to live. Incorporating the spiritual
          principles we learned in the first nine steps into our lives has made it possible to live
          in harmony with ourselves and others. Self-examination, confronting what we find in
          ourselves, and owning up to our wrongs are critical elements of conducting our lives on a
          spiritual basis. By working the Tenth Step, we become more aware of our emotions, our
          mental state, and our spiritual condition. As we do, we find ourselves constantly rewarded
          with fresh insight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of us look back at our Fourth Step and wonder why we have to do a Tenth Step. We may
          think that we’ve corrected all our past mistakes in the previous steps; since we have no
          intention of making those mistakes again, why should we continue with this relentless
          self-examination? The Tenth Step seems like a tiresome chore to some of us, a painful
          exercise that we could just as well avoid. But we must continue to grow, and that’s
          exactly what the Tenth Step helps us do. Though we will return to the previous steps again
          and again, the Tenth Step furthers our spiritual healing in a different way: by creating
          an awareness of what’s going on in our lives today.
        </p>
        <p>
          The importance of keeping in touch with our thoughts, attitudes, feelings, and behavior
          cannot be overemphasized. Every day, life presents us with new challenges. Our recovery
          depends on our willingness to meet those challenges. Our experience tells us that some
          members relapse, even after long periods of clean time, because they have become
          complacent in recovery, allowing their resentments to build and refusing to acknowledge
          their wrongs. Little by little, those small hurts, half-truths, and “justified” grudges
          turn into deep disappointments, serious self-deceptions, and full-blown resentments. We
          can’t allow these threats to compromise our recovery. We have to deal with situations such
          as these as soon as they arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Tenth Step, we use all the principles and actions we learned in the previous steps,
          applying them to our lives on a consistent basis. Beginning our days by reaffirming our
          decision to live life according to our Higher Power’s will has helped many of us keep
          spiritual ideals foremost in our minds throughout the day. Even so, we are bound to make
          mistakes that are very familiar to us. We can attribute virtually every wrongdoing to a
          character defect we identified in the Sixth Step. Humbly asking the God of our
          understanding to remove our shortcomings is just as necessary now as it was in the Seventh
          Step.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Tenth Step, we take such actions on a regular basis. Each day, we take our own
          inventory, look for those times when we fall short of our spiritual ideals, and renew our
          efforts to live a principle-centered life. For example, when we are faced with the
          tendency to behave compulsively, ignoring the consequences of our actions, we need to
          focus on spiritual principles, take prompt action, and continue forward in our recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although forming a habit of working this step may be difficult at first, we must persist.
          We can set aside some time during the day for focused self-appraisal while gradually
          moving toward a goal of being able to look at ourselves throughout the day. We keep going
          forward, striving each moment to become ever more aware of ourselves. We need to develop
          self-discipline; the more effort we put into doing so, the more we’ll find that working
          the Tenth Step will become as natural as breathing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not that we should be hard on ourselves, picking at our every motive and looking for
          problems where none exist. We need to stay in tune with the voice of our conscience and
          listen to what it’s telling us. When we get a nagging feeling that something isn’t quite
          right, we should pay attention to it. If our feelings of guilt or anger seem to go on for
          a long time, we can do something about them. We know when something is bothering
          us—perhaps not immediately, but usually not too long after the fact. As soon as we become
          aware that we’re feeling ill at ease, we search out the cause and deal with it as soon as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we strive to maintain ongoing awareness throughout the day, it is also helpful to
          sit down at the end of each day and quietly reflect on what has happened and how we
          responded to it. Often, our sponsor will suggest that we write out our Tenth Step. We may
          also make use of our informational pamphlet, Living the Program. In this step, we ask
          ourselves the same types of questions we asked in the Fourth Step; the only difference is
          that the emphasis is on today. We look at our current behavior and ask ourselves if we are
          living by our values. Am I being honest today? Am I maintaining personal integrity in my
          relations with others? Am I growing, or am I slipping back into old patterns? We
          concentrate on the overall picture of our day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to examine our day—or our life, for that matter—in its entirety, we have to draw
          on the humility we’ve acquired in the previous steps. We have learned quite a bit about
          ourselves: how we’ve responded to life in the past and how we want to respond to life now.
          It takes a great deal of awareness to humbly acknowledge our part in our own lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may have trouble knowing when we are wrong simply because we usually intend to be
          right. For instance, at some point in our recovery, we may attend a group business meeting
          firmly convinced that we know what the group should do. We’ve studied all sides of the
          issues. We forcefully share our views at the meeting. We’re so convinced of our rightness
          that we fail to recognize our self-righteousness. We are blind to the harm we’re causing
          others by not respecting their views as much as our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often we act in ways that are contrary to our values, yet we expect others to live up to
          our standards. For instance, we may find ourselves flinching when we hear others gossiping
          about someone. Following such an occurrence, we are likely to be self-righteous—until we
          catch ourselves doing the very same thing. Other situations can occur when we become
          supercritical of others. For example, we may have a tendency to have high expectations of
          others; however, we have a variety of excuses at hand for why these standards don’t ap-
          ply to us! If we find ourselves in the midst of such moral uncertainty, we can use the
          principles of the Tenth Step to provide more clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we’re aware that we’ve been wrong—whether it’s five minutes, five hours, or five days
          after the fact—we need to admit our error as soon as possible and correct any harm we’ve
          caused. As in the Ninth Step, we find that the process of admitting our mistakes and
          changing our behavior brings about tremendous freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, we must be just as careful when amending our current behavior as we were when
          we made amends in the Ninth Step. For instance, if we find that we were wrong because we
          sat in a meeting silently judging someone who shared, we certainly don’t need to go tell
          that person what we were thinking. Instead, we can make an effort to be more tolerant.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must remember that the Tenth Step isn’t a one-sided endeavor, an exercise in noting
          what we have done wrong. We must resist any urge to become obsessive with this step,
          ruthlessly searching out every flaw in our character. The point of the Tenth Step is for
          us to be willing to pay attention to our thoughts, behaviors, and values, then work on
          what we need to change. We should acknowledge that, quite often, our motives are good and
          we do things right. Character defects and character assets do not exclude each other, and
          we are sure to find both on any given day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We develop recovery-oriented goals for ourselves as we work this step. When we see that
          we’ve been afraid to go forward in a particular area of our lives, we can resolve to take
          a few risks, drawing our courage from our Higher Power. When we see that we’ve been
          selfish, we can strive to become more generous in the future. When we realize today that
          we’ve fallen short in any area of our lives, we don’t have to be overwhelmed by feelings
          of dread and fear of failure. Instead, we can be grateful for our self-awareness and begin
          to feel a sense of hope. We know that, by applying our program of recovery to our
          shortcomings, we will change and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          We begin to see ourselves more realistically as a result of working the Tenth Step. Many
          of us have remarked on the freedom we experienced through freely admitting our mistakes
          and releasing ourselves from unrealistic expectations. Where before we went from one
          extreme to another, either feeling better than everyone else or feeling worthless, we now
          find the middle ground where true self-worth can flourish. We feel renewed hope as we
          uncover long-neglected assets in this step. We see ourselves as we really are, accepting
          our good qualities along with our defects, knowing we can change with the help of a Higher
          Power. We are becoming what we were meant to be all along: whole human beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although all of us need the love and attention of others, that doesn’t mean we must depend
          on people to provide what we can only find within ourselves. We can stop making
          unreasonable demands on others and begin to give of ourselves in relationships. Our
          romantic relationships, our friendships, and our interactions with family members,
          co-workers, and casual acquaintances are undergoing an astounding change. We are free to
          enjoy another’s companionship because we’re no longer so obsessed with ourselves. We
          finally see that all the devices we use to keep other people away are unnecessary at best
          and, more often than not, are the underlying cause of the pain we suffer in our
          relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Healthier relationships are just one indication that the quality of our lives has improved
          dramatically. Such indications merely reflect the intangible but very real changes that
          have taken place inside us. Our entire outlook has changed. Compared to the spiritual
          values we hold dear today, concerns such as “looking good” or amassing material wealth
          pale in significance. By accepting the challenge of self-appraisal called for in the Tenth
          Step, we’ve discovered that we value our recovery and our relationship with the God of our
          understanding above all else.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the inner chaos that we lived with for so long subsides, we begin to experience long
          periods of serenity. During these times, we experience the powerful presence of a loving
          God in our lives. We are increasingly conscious of that Power and are ready to search for
          ways to maintain and improve our contact with it. Seeking direction and meaning for our
          lives, we go on to the Eleventh Step.
