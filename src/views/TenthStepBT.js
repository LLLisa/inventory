          Step Ten frees us from the wreckage of our present. If we do not stay aware of our
          defects, they can drive us into a corner that we can’t get out of clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first things we learn in Narcotics Anonymous is that if we use, we lose. By the
          same token, we won’t experience as much pain if we can avoid the things that cause us
          pain. Con- tinuing to take a personal inventory means that we form a habit of looking at
          ourselves, our actions, attitudes and relationships on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are creatures of habit and are vulnerable to our old ways of thinking and reacting. At
          times it seems easier to continue in the old rut of self-destruction than to attempt a new
          and seem- ingly dangerous route. We don’t have to be trapped by our old patterns. Today,
          we have a choice.

          The Tenth Step can help us correct our living problems and prevent their recurrence. We
          examine our actions during the day. Some of us write about our feelings, explaining how we
          felt and what part we might have played in any problems which oc- curred. Did we cause
          someone harm? Do we need to admit that we were wrong? If we find difficulties, we make an
          effort to take care of them. When these things are left undone, they have a way of
          festering.
        </p>
        <p>
          This step can be a defense against the old insanity. We can ask ourselves if we are being
          drawn into old patterns of anger, re- sentment or fear. Do we feel trapped? Are we setting
          ourselves up for trouble? Are we too hungry, angry, lonely or tired? Are we taking
          ourselves too seriously? Are we judging our insides by the outside appearances of others?
          Do we suffer from some physical problem? The answers to these questions can help us deal
          with the difficulties of the moment. We no longer have to live with the feeling that we
          have a “hole in the gut.” A lot of our chief concerns and major difficulties come from our
          inexperience with living without drugs. Often when we ask an oldtimer what to do, we are
          amazed at the simplicity of the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tenth Step can be a pressure relief valve. We work this step while the day’s ups and
          downs are still fresh in our minds. We list what we have done and try not to rationalize
          our actions. This may be done in writing at the end of the day. The first thing we do is
          stop! Then we take the time to allow ourselves the privi- lege of thinking. We examine our
          actions, reactions, and motives. We often find that we’ve been doing better than we’ve
          been feeling. This allows us to examine our actions and admit fault, before things get any
          worse. We need to avoid rationalizing. We promptly admit our faults, not explain them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We work this step continuously. This is a preventive action. The more we work this step
          the less we will need the corrective part of this step. This step is a great tool for
          avoiding grief before we bring it on ourselves. We monitor our feelings, emotions,
          fantasies and actions. By constantly looking at ourselves, we are able to avoid repeating
          the actions that make us feel bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need this step even when we’re feeling good and when things are going well. Good
          feelings are new to us, and we need to nurture them. In times of trouble, we can try the
          things that worked during the good times. We have the right to feel good. We have a
          choice. The good times can also be a trap; the danger is that we may forget that our first
          priority is to stay clean. For us, recovery is more than just pleasure.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to remember that everyone makes mistakes. We will never be perfect. However, we
          can accept ourselves by using Step Ten. By continuing a personal inventory, we are set
          free, in the here and now, from ourselves and the past. We no longer justify our
          existence. This step allows us to be ourselves.
